# Data-Exploration-using-Python
This project involves exploring the weather dataset from Kaggle. It has columns such as wind_speed_kmph, relative_humidity%,Weather conditions,Temperature and so on. The main idea behind this simple project was to leverage python, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.
